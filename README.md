# Queens & Knights
This is a solution in OCaml to the "Queens & Knights" [puzzle from ITA Software](https://web.archive.org/web/20130821070911/http://www.itasoftware.com/careers/puzzle_archive.html).  I wrote it in 2003, with a focus on speed rather than anything else (such as design), though I can see that I paid at least some attention to readability for someone who didn't know the language, so go me.

Perhaps by putting it up for all to see, I'll inspire myself to play around with it, and perhaps even improve it.  Or perhaps I'll decide that it's just fine as is!
